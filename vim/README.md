**Vim setup**

Setup tips, in case I forget.

- Plugin `neocomplete`
    - Requires Vim 7.3+ compiled with Lua support, and the `LuaXX.dll` included in the same directory as `gvim.exe`
- Installing plugins
    - Download `Vundle.vim` to `.vim/bundle/` or your OS equivalent
    - Run `:PluginInstall`
